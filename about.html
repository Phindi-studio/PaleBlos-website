    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>We believe in slowing down, even if it’s just for 15 minutes in the tub. Pale Blos was born from a deep need to reconnect with self, heal with scent, and remind women they are worthy of indulgence.</p>
    <p>We started in a tiny kitchen in Pretoria — mixing fizz, oils, and petals by hand — with a mission to create bath rituals for real women juggling real life.</p>
    <p>Today, we continue that mission with every bar, ball, and salt we craft. Locally made. Heartfully shared.</p>
